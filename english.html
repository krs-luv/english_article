<h2>THE STORY</h2>
<p>
    During a long day spent roaming around the forest in search of edible grains and herbs, the weary divine farmer accidentaly poisoned himself 72 times. But before the poisioning could actually end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth which when he chewed, revived his life.
</p>
<p>
    This is how we discovered tea or atleast that's how ancienct legends goes. Tea doesn't cure poisonings, but the story of the unkown farmer, the mythical Chinese inventor of agriculture highlight's the importance of tea to ancienct China. 
</p>
<img title="Another legend suggests that while the servant began boiling water for him, a dead leaf from a wild tea bush fell into the water. The servant didnâ€™t notice it and presented the water to the emperor who tasted it and found it very refreshing. Tea came then into being. " src="./static/shennog.jpeg" alt="">

<h2>THE FACTS</h2>
<p>
Tea, according to archaeological evidences was cultivated here as early as 6,000 years ago or 1,500 years before the pharaos built the Great Pyramid of Giza. The original Chinese tea plant is the same type that's grown around the world today, yet it was originally consumed in a different type.

<p>
It was eaten as a vegetable or cooked with grain porridge. Tea only shifted from food to drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination of moisture and heat can create a varied taste out of the leafy green. After a hundred years of modification to this process a standard procedure of making tea was created.

<br><br>
<h2>TEA- A CULTURE</h2>
<br><br>
<img title="In late eighth century a writer called Lu Yu wrote the first book entirely about tea, the Ch'a Ching, or Tea Classic." src="./static/tea2.jpg" alt="">
<br><br>
<p>
Matcha became so popular that a distinct Chinese tea culture emerged. Tea was the subject of books and poetry, the favourite drink of emperors, and a medium for artists. They would draw extravagnt pictures in the form of tea.

<h2>THE TEA ODYSSEY</h2>
<p>
In the 9th century during the Tang Dynasty, a Japenese monk brought the first tea plant to Japan. The Japanese eventually developed their unique rituals around tea leading to Japanese Tea Ceremony.

<p>
In 14th century, during the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes to loose tea leaf.

<br><br>
 At that point, China still held a virtual monopoly on the world's tea trees, making tea one of the three essential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and milk. This gave China a great deal of power and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world. 
</p>
<p>
That spread began around in earnest around the early 1600's, when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe in large quantites. Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza, a Portuguese noble woman, for making tea popular with the English aristocracy when she married King Charles II in 1661.

<h2>TEA MEETS INDIA</h2>
<p>
The British East India Company also wanted to able to grow tea themselves and further control the market. So they commissioned botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China in a covert operation.
<br><br>

<br><br>
 He disguised himself and took a perilous journey thorugh China's mountain tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees and experienced tea workers into Darjeeling, India. 
</p>
<p>
From there, the plant spread further still, helping drive tea's rapid growth as an everyday commodity.
